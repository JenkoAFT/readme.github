# user story
users access to jenko.io.

the platform enable the management of physical Artpieces using blockchain technology. the users (Artist, Galeries, collectors) can easily manage the data related to Artpieces, including its Certificate of Authenticity and the traceability while its physical transfer or when a transaction has been completed or is being to be completed. 

Each record of Artpiece as AFT (Art Fruit Token) enhance the Intellectual Property protection of the Artwork and its traceability while keeping user privacy. A smart contract is link at core to the Artpiece to enable fair transfer of the Artpiece from one to onother. Contrarely to NFT, the AFT can include a royalties system, upon request. 

the information agregatted along the life of the Artpiece by users (Artist, Galeries, collectors) will be recorded into the Blockchain and will be accessible by users anytime, while keeping user privacy. the Certificate of Authencity (CoA) can be prepared by all users but shall be always validated by the Artist. A fair agreement reinforces all users's legal rights arising from the physical transfer of Artpiece. The CoA cannot be changed once it is created. The CoA Ownership will be shown in Jenko Dashboard for all the Users associated to smart contract and resulting from the transaction of the Artpiece. 

for sake of clarity, Jenko is only in charge of transfering the Certificate when the conditions of the AFT Agreement are meet and excluding all financial transactions between users resulting from the sale of host of the Artpiece. Whenever a Royalties system have been set the same conditions apply.


# POC

the website is accessible from jenko.io.

once registered, the Artist can upload the picture and description of an Artpiece and create a unique certificate of authenthicity therefrom.

the Artpiece is certified and ready to be transfered to ("the Parties" : an agent, a galery, a Collector) with associated Contract that includes Royalties system.

"A Partie", once registered, accept the Legal Contract, and obtain the certificate of Authencity  once the Artpiece' property is transfered.

"Another Partie", once registered, accept the Legal Contract, and obtain the certificate of Authencity Ownership once the Artpiece' property is transfered.

"Another Partie etc .." once registered, accept the Legal Contract, and obtain the certificate of Authencity Ownership once the Artpiece' property is transfered. 

the payment system in fiat must be included once clicking on create (last step of Artpiece creation). this payment will not be necessary for each piece if the Artist buy a credit of XX Artpiece. 

The royalties system will be simulated in each user profile, upon the price recorded for each transaction.
